# everything queer  
everyone has two parents. except for a very small group of people, everyone had 2 people who contributed to their creation. however, were completely fine with calling people who did not do this our parents. we will still call someone our parent if they fill the roles society expects them to, and were completely fine with this. in fact, its rude, and even weird, to not do so. you wouldnt go to a parent teacher conference and lean in to the teacher and say, "just so you know, i'm not actually their biological parent." that would be weird! you also wouldnt go up to someone and say "you know youre not their biological parent, right?" that would be rude, because they already know that. youre not contributing anything to them, and youre lessening their position as a parent, which they may hold important to them. so really, youre just being a dick. and as a society, were completely ok with this. its easy to understand. were also completely ok with people who fill all the roles a parent usually would deciding not to call themselves a parent. for example, an aunt who takes care of and raises her siblings child. she probably wouldnt call herself that childs mother, shed still call herself their aunt. honestly, it would be kinda weird if she didnt. so as a society, were both completely fine and with calling people, who _are not our biological parents_, our parents, and completely fine with people who fill all the roles of a normal parent not being called a parent. this is all normal, and easy to understand for everyone.    

now, i must admit, i stole this metaphor from Yuval the Terrible, love that guy. but its just so incredible. a great way to describe this. have a guess what its about, it _should_ be easy.  

## labels
labels are very interesting topic to me. i totally get the need to have them for some people! but... i dont really like them. i believe the need for labels comes from a need for community, which is completely natural; people see a whole community of people _like_ them who call themselves, say, 'gay', and join in. however... this only works to a point.  

**nobody is identical!** i would even go so far as to say that everyone experiences gender and sexuality uniquely. because of this, labels can only go so far, and you'll never have a label that perfectly describes you short of _one you made up for yourself_. i have fallen into the trap myself - i have lost many years to figuring out just _what_ i am. but nowadays, i've just given up, and its a lot easier! its very difficult to find the perfect balance here though. naturally, it doesn't feel great to just. not know what you are. and i certainly havent achieved this! i still dont really have a general label for myself; "girl" is pretty close, but doesn't feel quite right. however, trying to narrow it down by stringing together a bunch of words like "transfem agender genderfluid blahblahblah" doesn't work either. i would just spend too much time trying to find the right words to describe it.  

labels also lock you in to some identity, and, at least for me, when you realise you've changed or you were wrong, it doesn't feel great. being confident in your identity feels great, but if you get too specific with it, it's very easy for that to get deconstructed. and once that happens there's a good chance you'll have to spend all that time figuring it out again.  

so, my point is, dont waste your time finding a label for yourself. **be happy with who you are, and accept that that can change.**  

## "straight" and "gay" don't exist
look, a lot of people wouldn't like this opinion, but i really dont get how you could _just_ like men or _just_ like women. if anyone truly believes that's true for them, i'd be very surprised, but i would suspect that their label is locking them into that attraction, making them disregard or not realise the other attraction that exists. which, i mean, is fine if you want to do that, i'm not saying otherwise, and i'm not saying thats not possible. but humans _simply aren't that simple_! you can't put anything human under a static, well-defined label. all lesbians have their exception, all straight men have ryan reynolds[\[1\]]("#footnote1").
